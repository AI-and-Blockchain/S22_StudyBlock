0,Individualizing Surveillance Mammography for Older Breast Cancer Survivors,"the investigators will develop a communication tool that summarizes recommendations for clinicians and patients for surveillance mammography and follow-up care for breast cancer survivors age ≥75. developing expert-panel recommendations, examining clinician and patient attitudes towards these recommendations, and testing a strategy for communication of expert recommendations on mammography cessation through direct engagement of specialists, primary care clinicians (pcs), and patients.
this is a multi-step study, the investigators will build on prior steps to develop consensus on surveillance mammography and follow-ups for breast cancer survivors who are age >= 75.
this study includes a physician focus group."
1,Carboplatin +/​- Nivolumab in Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer,"this research study is a phase ii clinical trial. phase ii clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. ""investigational"" means that the intervention is being studied.
the fda (the u.s. food and drug administration) has not approved nivolumab for your specific disease but it has been approved for other uses. the fda has approved carboplatin as a treatment option for your disease.
the purpose of this research study is to determine how well carboplatin, by itself, or together with nivolumab, works in treating breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. nivolumab is a recently discovered human monoclonal antibody. an antibody is a type of protein that your immune system (the system that defends your body against potentially harmful particles) uses to find and destroy foreign molecules (particles not typically found in your body, such as bacteria and viruses). scientists can now make antibodies in the laboratory and produce them for the treatment of many different diseases.
nivolumab works by attaching to and blocking a molecule called pd-1. pd-1 is a different molecule that can turn off the immune system by interacting with pd-l1 on the cancer cell. nivolumab has been shown in research studies to prevent pd-1 from shutting down the immune system, thus allowing it to recognize and help your body destroy the cancer cells. you are being asked to participate in this study because triple-negative breast cancer has shown elevated rates of pd-l1 expression.
nivolumab has been used in other research studies and information from those research studies suggests that nivolumab may help shrink or stabilize your triple negative breast cancer in this study"
2,A Phase II Study of Nivolumab in Combination With Cabozantinib for Metastatic Triple-negative Breast Cancer,"this research study is a phase ii clinical trial. phase ii clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. ""investigational"" means that the intervention is being studied.
the fda (the u.s. food and drug administration) has not approved the combination of nivolumab and cabozantinib as a treatment for any disease.
the fda has not approved cabozantinib for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses. the fda (the u.s. food and drug administration) has not approved nivolumab for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.
cabozantinib has been used in some phase i studies and information from those other research studies suggests that cabozantinib may help to shrink or stabilize breast cancer.
cancers are recognized by the immune system, and under some circumstances, the immune system may control or even eliminate tumors. an antibody is a natural protein made by the immune system that binds other proteins and molecules to fight infection and its ill effects. antibodies stimulating the immune system have been developed for treatment of human cancers. nivolumab is an experimental antibody drug that may make the immune response more active against cancer.
in this research study, the investigators are looking at how the participant's type of breast cancer responds to the combination of cabozantinib and nivolumab."
3,Fulvestrant Plus Enzalutamide in ER+/​Her2- Advanced Breast Cancer,"this is a single arm, non-randomized, open-label phase 2 study designed to evaluate the tolerability and clinical activity of adding enzalutamide to fulvestrant treatment in women with advanced breast cancer that are er and/or pr-positive and her2 normal. in this study 500 mg of fulvestrant will be given im on days 1, 15, 28, then every 4 weeks as per standard of care (soc) and 160mg of enzalutamide will be, in conjunction with fulvestrant, po daily."
4,A Randomized Phase II Study Of Eribulin Mesylate With or Without Pembrolizumab For Metastatic Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer,"this research study is a phase ii clinical trial. phase ii clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. ""investigational"" means that the intervention is being studied.
in this research study, the investigators are evaluating the safety and effectiveness of eribulin mesylate with or without pembrolizumab in metastatic hormone receptor positive breast cancer.
the fda (the u.s. food and drug administration) has not approved the combination of pembrolizumab and eribulin mesylate for breast cancer.
the fda has not approved pembrolizumab for this specific type of breast cancer but it has been approved in the united states for other diseases.
the fda has approved eribulin mesylate as a treatment option for this type of breast cancer.
pembrolizumab is a medicine that may treat cancer by working with the immune system. the immune system is the body's natural defense against disease. the immune system sends types of cells called ""t cells"" throughout the body to detect and fight infections and diseases, including cancer. for some types of cancer, the t cells do not work as they should and are prevented from attacking the tumors. pembrolizumab is thought to work by blocking a protein in the t cells called pd-1 (""programmed death 1""), which then may allow these cells and other parts of the immune system to attack tumors.
eribulin mesylate is developed from a natural substance found in a sea sponge. eribulin mesylate works by preventing cancer cells from multiplying.
the combination of pembrolizumab and eribulin mesylate is investigational. the study drugs, when given separately, work in different ways to stop the cancer cells from growing and spreading. however, it is not known if giving the two study drugs at the same time will have a better anti-cancer effect than giving each treatment on its own."
5,Breast Cancer Risk Reduction: A Patient Doctor Intervention (BreastCARE),"the proposed research combines the scientific advances in breast cancer research with health information technology (it) to design a personalized intervention that assesses breast cancer risk for women, disseminates important breast health information, and facilitates discussion of breast cancer risk reduction practices. our goal is to implement a tablet-pc (personal computer) based breast cancer risk education (breastcare) intervention in the primary care setting that estimates a woman's individual risk for breast cancer and provides her and her physician with personalized breast cancer risk information and recommendations for action."
6,Vitamin D and Breast Cancer Biomarkers in Female Patients,"objectives:

arm i: patients receive oral placebo once daily for 12 months.
arm ii: patients receive oral vitamin d (2000 iu) once daily for 12 months. tissue and blood samples are collected at baseline and at 12 months for laboratory biomarker analysis. patients also complete questionnaires at baseline and at 12 months."
7,NIMBUS: Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab in Metastatic Hypermutated HER2-negative Breast Cancer,"this research study is a phase ii clinical trial. phase ii clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. ""investigational"" means that the drug is being studied.
nivolumab is called an anti- pd-1 or a checkpoint inhibitor and is an antibody (a type of human protein) designed to allow the body's own immune system to destroy tumors. ipilimumab is called an anti-ctla-4 and is a type of antibody that works to prevent your body's immune system from stopping to fight this specific cancer.
the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) has not approved nivolumab for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses including but not limited to non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma and renal cell carcinoma.
the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) has not approved ipilimumab for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses such as melanoma and renal cell carcinoma.
the combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab may or may not increase anti-cancer activity by further boosting the immune system. at this time, the fda has not approved nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab for this specific disease although these drugs have been approved for other uses such as melanoma and renal cell carcinoma.
the purpose of this research study is to determine how nivolumab together with ipilimumab, works in treating breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. the investigators are also investigating whether there are certain dna or protein markers in the blood or tumor tissue that may indicate whether the combination will work in future patients"

9,TACTIC - TAA Specific Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes in Patients With Breast Cancer (TACTIC),"investigators will take a maximum of approximately 79 teaspoons of blood from patients on one to three occasions over a two-month period. under certain conditions related to the patient's health, blood may be collected using a process called apheresis. apheresis is the process where blood is passed through a machine that separates out the components of blood that we need. the remainder of the patient's blood will then be returned to his/her body.
investigators will use this blood to grow t cells. investigators will first grow a special type of cells called dendritic cells which will activate t cells. once these are made, investigators will load them with small pieces of protein called peptides taken from the taas that we want to target. this helps train the t cells to kill cancer cells which express taas on their surface. then the taa-specific ctls are expanded.
the cells will be infused by intravenous infusion (iv) into the patient over 1-10 minutes. the patient may be pre-treated with acetaminophen (tylenol) and diphenhydramine (benadryl). acetaminophen (tylenol) and diphenhydramine (benadryl) are given to prevent a possible allergic reaction to the taa-ctl administration. initially, two doses of taa-ctls will be given four weeks apart. the patient's cancer will be assessed pre-infusion, and then 6 weeks after the second infusion. if after the second infusion there is a reduction in the size of the patient's tumor on computed tomography (ct), magnetic resonance imaging (mri), or positron emission tomography (pet) as assessed by a radiologist, the patient can receive up to six (6) additional doses of the taa-ctls if they wish. at least one month should pass before each additional dose. all of the treatments will be given by the center for cell and gene therapy at houston methodist hospital.
in between the first and second taa-ctl infusions, and for 6 weeks after the 2nd infusion, the patient should not receive any other anti-cancer treatments such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy. if the patient does receive any other therapies in-between the first and second infusion of taa-ctls, they will be taken off treatment and will not be able to receive the second infusion.
medical tests before treatment:
before being treated, patients will receive a series of standard medical tests:
physical exam.
blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function.
measurements of the patient's tumor by routine imaging studies.
pregnancy test if the patient is a female who can have children.
medical tests during treatment:
patients will receive standard medical tests on the day of their second and subsequent infusions:
physical exam
blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function.
medical tests after treatment
- imaging study 6 weeks after the 2nd taa-ctl infusion.
to learn more about the way the taa-ctls are working in the patient's body, an extra 20-40 ml (4-8 teaspoons) of blood will be taken before each infusion, at weeks 1, 2, and 4 after the first cell dose and at weeks 1, 2, 4 and 6 after the second cell dose. afterwards, blood will be collected at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the 2nd infusion. investigators will use this blood to see how long the taa-ctls last, and to look at the patient's immune system response to the cancer. the immune system is part of the body that helps protect against disease.
study duration: the patient's active participation in this study will last for approximately one (1) year. if the patient receives additional doses of the taa-ctls as described above, his/her active participation will last until one (1) year after the last dose. investigators will then contact the patient once a year for up to 4 additional years (total of 5 years follow-up) in order to evaluate the patient's disease response long-term."
10,4D Image-Guided Partial Breast Radiation in Stage 0 and l Breast Cancer,"this is a pilot study enrolling about 30 patients to evaluate the feasibility of using 4d ct and daily image guidance in accelerated partial breast irradiation (apbi) to decrease set-up error and individualized planning target volumes to limit the non-target breast tissue dose. the two specific breasts constraints which shall be decreased are the v50 (percent volume of breast receiving 50% of the prescribed dose) and the v100 (percent volume of breast receiving 100% of the prescribed dose). the goal will be to decrease these to 45% and 23.5% respectively, which is down 33% from the nsabp b39 standard of 60% and 35%."
11,Involving Family to Improve Communication in Breast Cancer Care,"breast cancer is the most common cancer among survivors in the us. most patients with breast cancer receive help from family in making complex decisions about treatment, handling logistically demanding care coordination, and managing symptoms and side effects. although family members (as defined by each patient) play a vital role in cancer care, they are not formally recognized or assessed in care delivery, and their need for information and support is typically unmet. lack of attention to family in care delivery is an important gap that too often leaves families without adequate information about patient health and treatments. this may prevent families and patients from engaging in open conversations, cause them unnecessary anxiety, and negatively affect the quality of cancer care and delivery.
communication is particularly important in cancer care, as the optimal course of action is determined through longitudinal discussion of prognosis, treatments, and patient goals, preferences, and concerns. strategies to improve communication for serious illnesses such as cancer have been developed, but typically target a specific decision, conversation, or setting, most often the inpatient hospital. there is growing agreement that communication among patients, families, and providers should be initiated early and continue throughout the disease trajectory. however, little is known about how to provide both patients and families with access to timely information about patient health and mechanisms to communicate directly with health care providers, as proposed in this study.
the goal of this study is to test a multicomponent intervention to strengthen communication and longitudinal partnerships among women with breast cancer and their family members. recent work by the study team has demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, and benefit of intervention components which will be combined into a single model of care. the study team's preliminary studies indicate that clarifying patient and family expectations regarding the role of family and providing family with timely and comprehensive information about patient health (as desired by the patient) leads to more effective family involvement, more frequent patient-family-provider interactions, more patient-centered communication, and greater preparedness to manage care.
this study will evaluate the feasibility of delivering a multicomponent communication intervention in the outpatient setting comprising: 1.) a patient-family agenda-setting checklist completed immediately before a regularly scheduled medical oncology visit with a participating medical oncologist, 2.) facilitated registration for the patient portal (for patient and family member, as desired by the patient), and 3.) education (as relevant) on access to doctor's electronic visit notes. the study will focus on patients who typically attend medical oncology visits with a family member or trusted friend who are already present and involved in communication. this study will enroll up to 132 patients who are on active treatment for breast cancer, up to 132 family member/friend ""companions"" and up to 14 medical oncology providers. the study team will compare patients and companions who are in the intervention group (n=60 dyads) with patients and companions who are in the control group and receive usual medical oncology care (n=60 dyads). this study will compare quality of communication with medical oncology providers, understanding of patient's cancer, confidence in managing patient's care, satisfaction with cancer care, and symptoms of anxiety after 3 months, 9 months, and 12 months of follow-up."
12,"An Open-Label, Phase Ib/​II Clinical Trial Of Cdk 4/​6 Inhibitor, Ribociclib (Lee011), In Combination With Trastuzumab Or T-Dm1 For Advanced/​Metastatic Her2-Positive Breast Cancer","this research study is a phase ib/ii clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational intervention to use for further studies.
ribociclib is a drug that is designed to block certain proteins called cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) that are required for cells to divide. these proteins may also control the ability of certain cancers to grow.
in this research study, there will be 3 separate cohorts that are looking for the safe and tolerated dose of ribociclib that can be given in combination with other her2 directed therapy. one cohort will be looking at the safety of ribociclib in combination with trastuzumab emtansine (t-dm1). t-dm1 is a standard treatment for patients with her2-positive breast cancer. one cohort will be looking at the safety of ribociclib in combination with trastuzumab (herceptin), which is a standard treatment for patients with her2-positive breast cancer. the last cohort will be looking at the safety of ribociclib in combination with trastuzumab (herceptin) and fulvestrant (faslodex) for er-positive and her2-positive breast cancer. these are both standard treatments for this type of breast cancer.
the fda (the u.s. food and drug administration) has not approved ribociclib as a treatment for any disease."
13,Breast Cancer Detection: Comparison of Breast Tomosynthesis and Conventional Mammography,"the purpose of this study is to determine if: 1 the detection of breast cancer will be increased with conventional (2d) imaging plus tomosynthesis (3d) imaging, or 2. if the the detection of breast cancer will be increased with tomosynthesis (3d) imaging alone."
14,"Palbociclib In Combination With Letrozole As Treatment Of Post-Menopausal Women With HR+, HER2- Advanced Breast Cancer","to provide access to palbociclib to post-menopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive [hr(+)], her2-negative [her2(-)] abc who are deemed appropriate for letrozole therapy."
15,Intrathecal Trastuzumab for Leptomeningeal Metastases in HER2+ Breast Cancer,"phase i: patients will be treated in cohorts of 3-6 based on standard phase i dose escalation parameters requiring 0/3 or 1/6 patients per cohort to have a dlt before dose escalation. dosing is as follows: cohort 1-10 mg it, cohort 2-20 mg it, cohort 3-30 mg it and cohort 4-40 mg it. patients will be treated twice a week for 4 weeks, then once a week for 4 weeks, and then every 2 weeks. toxicity for dlt will be assessed during first 4 weeks of treatment. phase ii: patients will be treated with the mtd or maximal defined dose. patients will be treated twice a week for 4 weeks, then once a week for 4 weeks, and then every 2 weeks."
16,European Celecoxib Trial in Primary Breast Cancer (REACT),"it has long been recognised that there is an association between chronic immune activation and cancer but the mechanisms behind this observation are not fully understood. the inflammatory process may provide an environment for development of malignant disease, with mediators of inflammatory response such as the cyclo-oxygenases playing an important role and providing a target for therapeutic intervention.
prostaglandins (pgs) are synthesised from phospholipids by the action of phospholipase a2 and cyclo-oxygenases. cyclo-oxygenase (cox) -1 differs from cox-2 in that the latter is inducible and its expression is induced by a large range of oncogenes and growth factors. celecoxib is a selective cox-2 inhibitor that does not cause the effects of cox-1 inhibition, namely gastrointestinal ulceration.
the key regulatory step in this process is the enzymatic conversion of fatty acids to pgg2 and pgh2 by cox. pgh2 is subsequently converted to one of several structurally related pgs including pge2, pgd2, pgf2, and thromboxane a2 (txa2), by the activity of specific pg synthases. pgs have important functions in every organ system and regulate a variety of physiological functions such as immunity, maintenance of vascular integrity and bone metabolism. cox-2 is not normally expressed in most tissues, but is induced by a wide spectrum of growth factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines in specific pathophysiological conditions. the expression of cox-2 is highly induced in cells transformed with the oncogene v-src or treated with phorbol esters.
several studies have suggested an association between non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) consumption and decreased breast cancer risk.
elevated cox expression in breast cancer was suggested some time ago by the finding of elevated pg production in breast tumours.
there is pharmacological and genetic evidence to indicate that a significant component of the anticancer property of nsaids is due to their ability to inhibit the cox-2 enzyme.
this phase iii randomised study assesses the impact on disease free survival and overall survival of the cox-2 inhibitor celecoxib as maintenance therapy following surgery and chemotherapy in the treatment of primary breast cancer.
2590 women with primary breast cancer will be recruited in this study from several locations in the united kingdom and germany.
prior to randomization all patients should have completed at least 4 cycles of (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy. patients who satisfy all the eligibility criteria for the study will be informed and consented to join the study. the local investigator will then contact the iccg randomization centre to randomize the patient by fax or by telephone.
